# Enviromental Analysis of the Greater Los Angeles Area

The goal of this project is to understand the environmental
characteristics and the impact they have in the Greater Los Angeles
Area. We use the [CalEnviroScreen 3.0
dataset](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-30)
provided by the [The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment
(OEHHA)](https://oehha.ca.gov/). The CalEnviroScreen aims at
identifying the communities that burdened by pollution.

The project was implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. A
simple way to recreate the development environment is with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/). First, install `docker` and `docker-compose` in your computer. Download or git clone [these files](https://github.com/aproano2/config-mgmt/tree/master/docker/docker-anaconda3). In the same folder, execute the following command.
```
$ docker-compose up
```
Once that is completed, Jupyter Notebooks is available at [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

In this project, we use the cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM).


1. Business Understanding

To guide the project, we use following questions:

- What are the main factors that contribute to the pollution burden in Los Angeles?
- What are the less poluted areas in Los Angeles?
- What are the areas with lowest unemployment?
- Is there a correlation between socio-economic factors and pollution burden?
- How well can we predict the pollution burden?
- How well can we predict cardiovascular diseases?

2. Data Understanding

3. Prepare Data

4. Data Modeling

5. Evaluate the Results

6. Deploy
